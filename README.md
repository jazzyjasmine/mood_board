## Search images by related concept

## Select images
- User can select their preferred images to put onto their mood board by clicking on the images. The selected image becomes dim after clicking, indicating that this image has been selected.
- User can recall selection by clicking on a selected image (dim image) again. The image will turn back to the normal brightness and it is released from selection.
